# PAS-password-archive-system

** WEAK PASSWORD, TRY AGAIN** 

You have faced this situation right?

Well, I have created a small App to solve this.

Name of the app: PAS( Password Archive System)



Workings: 

1. Execute the Python file. ( python3 password_creator.py )

2. In a user interface, it will ask you "where to use the password" & "what should be the length of the password".

3.  It will automatically create a Strong Password for you and store it in a key-value pair in a JSON file so that you don't need to remember the password.

eg. You typed Facebook as your password application & length as 6.

JSON --> { 'Facebook' : '<Automatically generated strong password>' } 

Recommended practice: Make a copy of the updated JSON file and store it on google drive so that you can use it remotely also.

Requirements:
1. Python > 3
2. pip install tk
